## Description

We all know and love this classic game called, “Tic Tac Toe”. It has been around forever and it is extremely handy in a time where two people might be bored out of their minds. I would play this game a ton when I was younger with my grandmother and sometimes still do to pass the time. This game can go on forever, whether or not the two people playing get tired of playing or their next idea comes along. 


## Deployment

The web game is deployed at (https://hailleya.github.io/)


## Game Logic
The player needs to make their line either horizontal, vertically or diagonally with their character in order to win the game. They will continue this process until the player is tired of playing the game. The player can choose to be either X or O and where they want to put the character they chose down. The board will display their character and then the second player will put their character down to end their turn. This will continue until either player wins or it ends in a draw. The player will know that they’ve won with text stating "X/O has won !" that will display when the game finishes. This is the same for when the opposing side wins and or if there is a draw!


### Post-MVP Plans


- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.

a scoreboard! that'd be good ! 

- Another that will be a stretch.

I want to add a confetti effect to the screen when either player wins. I want to add a multiplayer choice and a player versus bot option. 

 Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)

how would i make a computer/AI/bot be able to play so this game can have one player? Not sure how to start that
