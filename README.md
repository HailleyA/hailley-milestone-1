## Description

We all know and love this classic game called, “Tic Tac Toe”. It has been around forever and it is extremely handy in a time where two people might be bored out of their minds. I would play this game a ton when I was younger with my grandmother and sometimes still do to pass the time. This game can go on forever, whether or not the two people playing get tired of playing or their next idea comes along. But in this version, you are up against a bot so do your best to outsmart them!


## Deployment

The web game is deployed at (https://hailleya.github.io/)


## Game Logic
The player needs to make their line either horizontal, vertically or diagonally with their character in order to win the game. They will continue this process until the player is tired of playing the game. The player can choose to be either X or O and where they want to put the character they chose down. The board will display their character and then the bot will put their character down to end their turn. This will continue until either player wins or it ends in a draw. The player will know that they’ve won with a sound effect that will play when the game finishes, if they lose, another sound effect will play, if there is a draw, there will be an effect shown on the screen to reflect that game outcome.


### Post-MVP Plans


- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.

a scoreboard! that'd be good ! 

- Another that will be a stretch.

I want to add a confetti effect to the screen when the player wins, not the bot. 

 Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)

not sure what else i can do
